# Data Science Related University Courses

In the final year of my mathematics degree, I decided that I wanted to pursue a data science career and took as many machine learning and statistics courses as I was able to. Below are two courses I am particularly proud of, and I have given summaries of all the projects/assignments I did for each course. ***Click on the assignment titles (in blue) for links to the repositories where you can see all my work including the code.***

I will also be posting some of the personal data science projects that I have done/am currently working on, but that is still a work in progress.
