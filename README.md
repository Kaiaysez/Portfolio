Highlights: 
* Discussion on machine learning vs statistical methods.
* Discussion on modelling and model validation.

### [Assignment 2: Assignment featuring EDA, multivariate hypothesis testing, and clustering (Code: R)](https://github.com/Kaiaysez/STAT3006-Assignment-2) 
Highlights: 
* Mathematical derivation of the EM algorithm update equations.
* Implementing the K-Means and the EM algorithm and comparing the two methods.
* Selecting the number of clusters using the gap statistic. 

### [Assignment 3: Assignment featuring supervised learning (Code: Python)](https://github.com/Kaiaysez/STAT3006-Assignment-3)
Highlights: 
* Distinguishing between real and fake bank notes using a linear support vector machine classifier mathematically derived and programmed from scratch.

### Assignment 4: Assignment featuring high dimensional data (Code: Python + R)
Highlights:
* Performing dimensionality reduction on handwritten digits (MNIST dataset) via auto-encoders and principle component analysis in R. 
* Carrying out multivariate hypothesis testing and false discovery rate methods in R to test whether there is a difference in distribution of gene expression levels between Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia cells and Acute Myeloid Leukemia cells.
* Implementing elastic net regression via the glmnet package in R.
